# Gestalt

> **geÂ·stalt (n):** _Something that is made of many parts and yet is somehow more than or different from the combination of its parts; broadly : the general quality or character of something._

Gestalt is a simple and elegant PHP package for managing your framework's configuration values. It is lightweight, flexible, framework agnostic, and has no dependencies other than PHP itself.

### Features
- **Lightweight:** Gestalt is built to be lightweight. No dependencies, no bloat, just an object-oriented wrapper around your framework's configuration.
- **Powerful:** Who said lightweight means powerless? Gestalt has a small footprint but packs a mean punch. Just take a look at its [Custom Loaders](#) and [Observers](#) and you'll see for yourself.
- **Flexible:** Developers like to do things _our_ way. Gestalt gives you the flexibility to integrate seamlessly with how you store your configuration values.
- **Expressive syntax**: With its clean, collection-like syntax, code artisans will feel right at home. Not to worry messy developers, you'll like it too!
